## Snakes
Snakes are piecewise curves that are iteratively fitted to image data by moving their control points 

* A smooth 2D curve which matches to image data
* Initialized near target, iteratively refined
* Can restore missing data

$E =\int_{s=0}^{s=1} \alpha|\frac{dP(s)}{ds}|+\beta|\frac{dP^2(s)}{ds^2}|+\gamma I(P(s))ds$
$=E_{elastic}+ E_{curvature} + E_{external}$

where $\alpha$ regularizes control point spacing
$\beta$ controls curvature
$\gamma$ encourages the curve to cover edge pixels

* Low weight on $\alpha$  
spacing between points can be irregular. This can lead to loss of accuracy
Larger α increases stiffness of curve

* Low weight on $\beta$
curvature can be very high. This can lead to sharp discontinuities in curves and doubling back

* Low weight on $\gamma$ 
image has little influence over internals. The snake doesn’t fit the underlying data very well




$E_{elastic} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 + (y_{i+1}-y_i)^2-\bar d$
$E_{curvature} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-2x_i+x_{i-1})^2 + (y_{i+1}-2y_i+y_{i-1})^2$

external could also be gradient-based
$E_{external} = -\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|G_x(x_i,y_i)|^2+|G_y(x_i,y_i)|^2$

The first two internal terms are functions of the curve’s shape
The final external term is based on the image content

### Williams / Shah fitting
greedy search
allow corners/discontinuities 
1. For each control point, in turn, move the control point to the location in its 3x3 neighbourhood minimising E
2. If all the follow criteria are met, set $\beta$ to zero at the control point
a. curvature at control point larger than both its neighbours 
b. curvature at control point is larger than a basic threshold  
c. edge strength at control point is above threshold

## Point Distribution Model(PDM)
build a statistical shape model from a set of contours using an Eigenmodel
A major issue using PDMs with images is need to create correspondence between control points

### Procrustes Analysis
align a pair of edge maps by translating, rotating and uniformly scaling one shape to match the other
1. Translate the object’s centroid to align with that of the model
2. Rotate the model to minimize the Sum of Square Differences (SSD)
3. Scale the model to minimize the Sum of Square Differences (SSD)

## Active Shape Model(ASM) 
an active contour (snake) where control point movement is governed by a PDM

We assume we have an initial estimate for the pose and shape parameters (eg the mean shape). This is iteratively updated as follows:
1.  Look along normals through each model point to find the best local match for the model of the image appearance at that point (eg strongest nearby edge)
2. Update the pose and shape parameters to best fit the model instance to the found points
3. Repeat until convergence 

perform gradient descent in the Eigenmodel space

The performance can be significantly improved using a multi-resolution implementation, in which we start searching on a coarse level of a gaussian image pyramid, and progressively refine. This leads to much faster, more accurate and more robust search.

## Tracking
1. Use final contour/model extracted at frame  t  as an initial solution for frame t+1
2. Evolve initial contour to fit exact object boundary at frame t+1
3. Repeat, initializing with most recent frame.
