## Homogeneous Coordinates
rotation about arbitary point:
1. translate frame so that the rotation centroid is into origin
2. rotation $\theta$ degree
3. translate back
$p^\prime = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & c_x\\
0 & 1 & c_y\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -c_x\\
0 & 1 & -c_y\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}p
$
## Transformation
* linear: rotation ,shear, scaling
* affine: linear + translation
* projective

* Affine Fitting (2D)
$M = \begin{bmatrix}
m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13}\\
m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23}\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$
6 unknowns, 3 pairs of correponding points

### RANSAC
RANdom Sampling And Consensus
1. Select a subset of the data d from D
2. Generate model M from d that well explains d
3. Test M’s accuracy over all of D
4. If the accuracy isn’t good enough, iterate back to 1 up to MAXITER times

Apply RANSAC to fit contours to images
we could just repeatedly guess 3 point correspondences, derive an M, and after so many iterations, use the best estimate for M so far, i.e. contour configuration that overlaps the most edge pixels

## Homography
2D-2D transformation
$H = \begin{bmatrix}
h_1 & h_2 & h_3\\
h_4 & h_5 & h_6\\
h_7 & h_8 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$
8 unknowns, 4 pairs of correponding points

### SVD
extract eigenvectors $V$, and the coefficients $US$ to reconstruct the data

$A=USV^T$
$A: m\times n$
$U: n\times r$:orthonormal left singular vectors
$S: r\times r$ diagonal sigular value matrix; r is rank of A
$V: n \times r$: orthonormal right singular vectors

$A^TA = VS^TSV^T$
$AV = US$

* The eigenvectors of $A^TA$ make up the columns of $V$ 
* The eigenvectors of $AA^T$ make up the columns of $U$
* The singular values in $S$ are square roots of eigenvalues from $A^TA$ or $AA^T$ 

Applications:
* for least square problem $Ax = 0$, take SVD of A, the solution is the right eigenvector $V$ corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue (L2 norm is the sum of variance)
* for m data vectors, the covariance is $C = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m(x^i - \bar x) = \frac{1}{m}XX^T$, then take SVD of X, the data can be projected into the eigenvector by $U^TX$

### Feature matching
Measure difference as Euclidean distance between feature vectors
1. Pick the nearest neighbor. Threshold on absolute distance
Problem: Lots of self similarity in many photos
2. Nearest neighbor distance ratio between distances to the nearest and 2nd nearest neighbors
Sorting by this ratio puts matches in order of confidence

Even when pick best match, still lots (and lots) of wrong matches due to outliers

### RANSAC for Mosaicing
Least square esitmation is not robust to outliers
Two-stage process:
1. Classify data points as outliers or inliers
2. Fit model to inliers while ignoring outliers

RANSAC
1. Pick 4 points from the left image at random and find their correspodence in the right image
2.  Derive the homography H 
3. Measure the forward-backward transfer error E(H) 
$E(H) = \sum_{i=1}^N|Hp_i-q_i|+|H^{-1}q_i-p_i|$
Points that match within a certain distance are called inliers (the rest, outliers)
4. Repeat until 
* inlier ratio reaches expected ratio of inliers
* max iterations N reached 

Number N of samples required to ensure, with a probability p, that at least one random sample produces an inlier set that is free from “real” outliers for a given s and e
$1-(1-(1-e)^s)^N = p$
$N = \frac{log(1-p)}{log(1-(1-e)^s)}$ 
where 
N = number of samples
e = probability that a point is an outlier (proportion of outliers)
s = number of points in a sample
p = desired probability that we get a good sample e.g. p = 0.99

### Depth Parallax
Homography will only align the dominant plane in each image
Not everything can be aligned by a single plane-plane transformation
