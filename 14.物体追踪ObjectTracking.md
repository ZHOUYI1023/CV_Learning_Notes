## Background Substraction
per pixel mean over frames
object binary mask = threshold(current frame - background frame)
## Blob Tracking
* color model of target object
(eigen model)
* use the model to find target and create a mask
* use the centroid

problem: multiple connected components (e.g. hands)

## Nearest Neighbour Tracking
based on distance
no temporal information

problem: 
* clutter: distractors -> discriminative
* occlusion -> motion model

## Template Tracking
search all positions in the frame for the presence of template
* cross correlation
    * sum of squared differences (SSD)
    * normalized cross correlation (NCC)
    substract mean to give some invariance to illumination change
    Pearson coefficient [-1,1]
* thershold 
* nearest neighbour

problem: over longer sequences, apperance changes

## Recursive Bayesian Filter
Bayes Theorem
$P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)} = \frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X|Y)P(Y)+P(X|\bar Y)P(\bar Y)}$

## Kalman filter
![](\images\EKF.png)
* Restricted to Gaussian densities
* Uni-modal distribution: single hypothesis
* Only linear, continuous dynamic model
![](\images\kfpf.png)

## Particle Filter
* Nonlinear dynamic 
* Multi-modal and therefore non-Gaussian
* Multiple samples provides multiple hypotheses

### 1. select

### 2. predict
* First, an element undergoes drift and, since this is deterministic, identical elements in the new set undergo the same drift.
* The second predictive step, diffusion, is random and identical elements now split because each undergoes its own independent Brownian motion step.

## CONDENSATION
CONditional DENSity PropagATION
first introduce particle filter into computer vision
Probabilistic framework for tracking objects such as curves in clutter
* The problem is to track outlines and features of foreground objects, modelled as curves, as they move in substantial clutter, and to do it at, or close to, video frame-rate.
* This is challenging because elements in the background clutter may mimic parts of foreground features.
* In the most severe case of camouflage, the background may consist of objects similar to the foreground object, for instance, when a person is moving past a crowd.
* Kalman Filter work relatively poorly in clutter which causes the density for xt to be multi-modal and therefore non-Gaussianã€‚
