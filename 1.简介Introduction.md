* Bottom-up Processing:
    * Low Level : e.g. edge detection
    * Mid Level : e.g. connect edge pixels to form region; shape analysis
    * High Level : e.g. analyse region adjacency; ==semantics/rules== for combination of regions 
* Top-down Processing: Fit a model to the raw data
    * Fitness function
    * Heuristic constraints
    * Optimization
* Hybrid: simplify the top-down fitting problem by doing some preliminary bottom-up analysis


Methodology:
* Heuristic: encode our intellgience/prior knowledge of how to solve problems
* Learning: by example
