The (plausible) hallucination of missing detail in photographs
Application Area:  Image Restoration, Object Removal
## Interpolation: 
* e.g. Laplacian in-painting
* Good for small holes, no edge artifacts
### Laplacian In-painting
In-painting refers to the smooth interpolation of holes within an image
Laplacian should be zero (or as low as possible) when computed over the values proposed for the unknown pixels.

## Texture Synthesis:  
* e.g. Patch based / Freeman-Efros
* Good for large holes, structure aware but edge artifacts
### Patch based in-painting
Instead of interpolating, copy and paste small patches of pixels from the background to fill the hole
![](\images\patch_inpainting.png)
Each iteration, paste patches partially overlapping hole.  
Work inwards gradually.  

Build a database of patches from known area of image
Each patch is reduced to a vector describing its contents
Concatenate R, G, B values of every pixel in patch

Once the best patch has been identified, paste it into image
Only over-write pixels within the hole (or artifacts occur)

Freeman-Efros Results
Trade-off between structure preservation (patch size) and coherence(consistent).  Larger patches = complex structure = artifacts
