Compositing is the process of combining visual elements from multiple images into a single image
* Used extensively in photo manipulation, movie vfx, etc.
* Typically a Matte is used to identify visual elements to composite

Usually deal with RGBA (4 channel) images when compositing
* Alpha channel (4th channel) represents transparency of pixels
* Convention is 0=transparent, 1=opaque  (continuous scale)
* The matte is typically encoded in the alpha channel
## Porter-Duff Compositing
Porter and Duff studied the 12 permutations by which 2 images may be combined 
Porter duff implements alpha blending by (conceptually) considering area of contribution within each pixel

A over B; considering alpha

Problems with Porter Duff
it assumes a good matte (alpha field) can be painted.
Many natural structures are fine and/or translucent e.g. hair making it very hard to paint a good matte.
Edge detail is lost at the boundary of the composited image


## Gradient domain compositing
Ideally we should retain all edge (i.e. gradient) information   at the boundary of the composition.
Ensure Laplacian of dest = Laplacian of source for all composited pixels.

## Seam Carving
Seam carving is a form of content aware scaling operation that discards non-salient (unimportant) areas of an image to reduce its size

Each pixel is assigned a weight e.g. using edge strength (or similar).
Can remove seams of pixels that don’t intersect salient regions i.e. the sum of pixel weights along the “seam” is low
