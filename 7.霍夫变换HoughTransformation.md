## Line Parameterisation
$y=mx+c$ what if x = K -> infinite gradient iof vertical lines
represent in $(\theta, r)$
$r = x\cos(\theta)+ y\sin(\theta)$
where $\theta \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, $r\in R$ 

$r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}sin(\theta+\phi)$ is a sinusoidal curve
where $\tan(\phi) = \frac{x}{y}$


## Hough Transformation
### Lines
For each edge pixel in the image find all lines $(r,\theta)$ passing through it
Parameter space divided into cells which act as vote counters 
Choose a good grid / discretization
==Lines of finite length?==
1. Initialize $H[r, \theta]=0$
2. for each edge point $I[x,y]$ in the image
   for $\theta = [\theta_{min}  :  \theta_{max} ]$  // some quantization
    $r = x\cos(\theta)+ y\sin(\theta)$
    $H[r, \theta] += 1$
3. Find the value of $(r, \theta)$ where $H[r, \theta]$ is maximum
4. The detected line in the image is given by $r = x\cos(\theta)+ y\sin(\theta)$

Extension: select $\theta$ as the estimated gradient at (x,y) to reduces degrees of freedom



### Circles
$r^2 = (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2$

For every edge pixel (x,y) : 
For each possible radius value r:
For each possible gradient direction θ: 
// or use estimated gradient at (x,y)
$a = x + r cos(θ)$ // column
$b = y - r sin(θ)$  // row
$H[a,b,r] += 1$
	end
end

### Generalized Hough Transform
Define a model shape by its boundary points and a reference point.
Offline procedure:
* At each boundary point, compute displacement vector: $r = a – pi$
* Store these vectors in a table indexed by gradient orientation $θ$

Detection procedure:
For each edge point:
* Use its gradient orientation $θ$ to index into stored table 
* Use retrieved $r$ vectors to vote for reference point

### Pros & Cons
Pros
* All points are processed independently, so can cope with occlusion, gaps
* Some robustness to noise: noise points unlikely to contribute consistently to any single bin
* Can detect multiple instances of a model in a single pass

Cons
* Complexity of search time increases exponentially with the number of model parameters 
* Non-target shapes can produce spurious peaks in parameter space
* Quantization: can be tricky to pick a good grid size
