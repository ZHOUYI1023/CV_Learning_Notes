## Phong Shading Model
The intensities we see in an image are a combination of:

## Lambertian (Diffuse) Shading
![](images\lambert.png)
An ideal Lambert matte surface
* Reflects all incident light with no absorbtion
* Reflects any incident light equally in all directions

Albedo (meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation
It is a good approximation for many materials e.g. snow, soot, matte paint, lunar surface
## Specular Component
The specular component is view-direction dependent

where $m$ is a shininess constant for this material, which is larger for surfaces that are smoother and more mirror-like. When this constant is large the specular highlight is small.

## Phong Shading Equation

Ambiguity:
Same value for $\cos \theta_s$ can arise from two possible $n$

## Shape from Shading
Estimate surface shape using intensity (shading) by ‘reversing’ the Phong Shading Equation

By making several simplifications (scene assumptions):
* Only consider Lambertian (diffuse) shading
* Need 2 or more photos; same static scene + different light sources
* Light sources considered to be distant point sources
* Consider constant material (i.e. albedo) everywhere

## Surface Geometry

## Reflectance map  
![](images\reflectance_map.png)
The light reflected from a surface depends on the orientation of the surface with respect to the viewer and the light source.

We assume that the intensity of a pixel  I(x,y) = R(p,q) i.e. that the pixel in the image perfectly describes the irradiance of the surface


## Photometric stereo
![](images\photometric_stereo1.png)
![](images\photometric_stereo2.png)
Usually use 3 images (with different lighting) to get unique (p,q)
Practically this is usually done with a single photo illuminated under three widely positioned pure R, G, B lights.  Then each channel used.
![](images\photometric_stereo.png)
The result of photometric stereo is a normal (n) vector for each pixel
* By “relighting” the normal map we can produce the illusion of lighting the object from different points of view
* Or we can re-texture by varying the albedo
