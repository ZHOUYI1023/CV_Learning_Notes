## Camera Geometry
### Euler Angle
Gimbal lock
the loss of one degree of freedom in a three-dimensional when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration

### Pin-hole Model
![](\images\pinhole.png)
Field of view is inverse proportionalt to focal length

$u=\frac{d}{z}x+c_x\newline v=\frac{d}{z}y+c_y$

### Perspective Projection

### Visual Hull
If we work out which voxels are occupied by a person/object then we will have produced a 3D model.  We call this the visual hull.
```
For each voxel (x,y,z) in the capture volume
	Let counter=0
	For each calibrated camera
		Project (x,y,z) to (u,v)
		If (u,v) is set, then counter =counter+1
	End
	If counter == total cameras, then voxel is part of hull
End
```
### Triangulation
Given a pair of 2D points, captured with calibrated cameras
The 3D point is at the intersection of the two rays

### Finding F â€“ The 8 Point Algorithm
![](\images\fmatrix.png)
use 8 pairs of corresponding points between a pair of images 
![](\images\8point.png)
use SVD to get the least square solution

## RANSAC for Fundamental Matrix
1. Pick 8 points from the left image at random
2. Using pre-computed matches, find 8 corresponding points in the right image
3. Derive the fundamental matrix F from these 8 pairs of corresponding points
4. Measure the forward-backward transfer error E(F) between all points using F. Points that match within a certain distance are called inliers (the rest, outliers)
5. Repeat until max iterations reached or log(1-p)/log(fraction of outliers). Where p=desired probability of a result having no outliers e.g. 0.99.
